# 🩺 Analysis of Chronic Kidney Disease and Water Sources in Sri Lanka (2012)

## 📘 Project Overview
This project analyzes the relationship between **kidney disease prevalence** and **water sources** across districts in Sri Lanka using 2012 data.  
The goal is to identify patterns between the use of **groundwater** and the incidence of **chronic kidney disease (CKD)**, providing insights into potential environmental and regional risk factors.

## 📂 Dataset Description
The dataset includes information from Sri Lankan districts, covering:

| Column | Description |
|:--|:--|
| **District** | Name of the administrative district |
| **Population** | Total population in 2012 |
| **Kidney Patients** | Number of reported kidney disease cases |
| **Tap Water Usage (%)** | Percentage of population using tap water |
| **Groundwater Usage (%)** | Percentage of population using groundwater |
| **Other Sources (%)** | Percentage using other water sources |

---

## 🧠 Key Insights
- Districts with **higher groundwater dependency** show a **greater number of kidney disease cases**.  
- **North Central** and **Uva** provinces record the **highest prevalence**.  
- Access to **safe tap water** correlates with **lower disease rates**.  
- Results highlight the importance of **clean water access and water quality monitoring**.

## 📈 Visualizations Created
- 🗺️ **Map View:** District-wise patient percentage and water source distribution.  
- 🍩 **Donut Charts:** Safe vs. unsafe drinking water ratio by district.  
- 📊 **Bar Charts:**  
  - Sources of drinking water (tap vs. ground).  
  - Safe and unsafe water percentage by district.  
  - Number of kidney patients by district.  
- 🔢 **KPI Cards:** Sample Size (**5M**) and Total Patients (**62K**).  
- 🎛️ **Interactive Filters:** Select districts to explore detailed regional trends.
